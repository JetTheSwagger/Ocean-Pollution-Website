                <h5 class="subtitle">
                    Ocean pollution is the pollution of the ocean caused by human activities. It is a global problem
                    that impacts our ocean, our health and our wellbeing. Marine litter, also known as marine debris, is
                    human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a sea or ocean. Floating
                    oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing
                    aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is
                    called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood and drift seeds, are also
                    present.

                <h5 class="subtitle">
                    Oil spills are one of the most visible types of pollution in the ocean. They occur when crude oil is
                    accidentally released into a body of water by an oil tanker, refinery, storage facility, underwater
                    pipeline or offshore oil-drilling rig. Oil spills can be extremely harmful to the environment,
                    especially if they occur in a body of water that provides a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife.
                    Oil spills can also be harmful to human health, especially if people are exposed to the oil or fumes
                    from the oil for long periods of time. <br> <br>

                <h5 class="subtitle">
                    Plastics form 65 to 90% of this garbage according to Plastic Pollution. There was an estimated 165
                    million tons of plastic in the oceans by 2017 reports Business Insider International. This comes as
                    no surprise to anyone who has seen plastic bags and bottles, and other waste floating onto the
                    beaches. This is because in the last 50 year, plastic has grown to 20 times the rate back then. <br>
                    <br>
                    Aside from trash, industrial waste is one of the major issues when it comes to ocean dumping. Until
                    the mid 1970s it was legal to dump industrial waste including nuclear material into oceans, and some
                    illegal dumping still continues fears The MarineBio Conservation Society (MarineBio); in fact,
                    20-25% of dredging waste ends in oceans. This includes toxic chemicals which are a death sentence
                    for ocean life forms <br> <br>
                    The garbage dumped directly in the oceans comes from offshore drilling rigs and various commercial,
                    cargo, and pleasure ships, according to California Coastal Commission.

                <h5 class="subtitle">
                    As an Earth Island News report notes, the old rule "dilution is the solution to pollution" has
                    caused much of the pollution not just of waterways, but also oceans. Encyclopedia.com explains this
                    was the method used to dispose of waste when populations were small. It unfortunately continues even
                    now, despite many acts and rules. <br> <br>
                    Several forms of everyday waste produced on land end up in the ocean. Since most rivers empty into
                    oceans, anything dumped into streams and rivers eventually reach oceans points out World Wide Fund
                    for Nature (WWF) in the Marine Problems report. <br> <br>
                    This leads to an increase in nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus that causes eutrophication
                    and lack of oxygen. The result is dead zones in oceans as well as inland water bodies explains
                    Scientific American. There are 400 dead zones in the world. This is also called nutrient pollution
                    according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Effects report. It can also lead to
                    coral bleaching and disease elaborates Oregon State University.
